            <h2>Common Questions (FAQ)</h2>
            <p class="avyard-faq-lead">
                Answers to common questions about Independent Educational Evaluations, parent rights under IDEA, and the
                CAS assessment process.
            </p>

            <div class="faq-grid">
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Who has the right to request an IEE?</h3>
                    <p>Under IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act), parents have the right to request an
                        Independent Educational Evaluation at public expense if they disagree with the school district's
                        evaluation. The district must either fund the IEE or initiate a due process hearing to defend
                        their assessment.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What assessment areas does CAS cover?</h3>
                    <p>CAS provides Independent Educational Evaluations in all special education domains:
                        Psychoeducational (cognitive, academic, social-emotional), Speech & Language Pathology,
                        Occupational Therapy, Physical Therapy, Adapted Physical Education, and Assistive
                        Technology—each conducted by appropriately licensed specialists.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What is the timeline for completing an IEE?</h3>
                    <p>From signed consent to final report delivery, CAS completes comprehensive evaluations within 30
                        days. This includes all testing sessions, observations, scoring, analysis, and report
                        writing—ensuring timely results for IEP meetings and educational planning.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Will the evaluator attend the IEP meeting?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. CAS evaluators are available to attend IEP meetings (in-person or virtually) to present
                        findings, answer questions, clarify recommendations, and collaborate with the IEP team. This
                        ensures our assessment results are fully understood and appropriately integrated into the
                        student's educational program.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Does CAS meet district IEE criteria?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. CAS evaluators hold all required state licenses and credentials, use current standardized
                        assessment instruments, follow professional ethical guidelines, and produce reports that meet
                        both state and federal special education requirements. We work with districts throughout
                        California and are familiar with varying local IEE policies.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Are telehealth/virtual assessments available?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. CAS offers both in-person and telehealth evaluation options using validated digital
                        assessment tools. Virtual assessments are particularly useful for students in remote areas,
                        those with scheduling constraints, or when in-person testing presents barriers—while maintaining
                        the same rigorous standards as traditional evaluations.</p>
